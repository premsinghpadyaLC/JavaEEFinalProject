Student No: C0924501
Course: Java EE – Lambton College


📝 Project Overview
Developed a Movie Catalogue System using Java Spring Boot as the capstone project. This system is fetching trending movies and movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, displaying it to users, and allowing favoriting of movies.


💻 Technologies Being Used
• Java
• Spring Boot (MVC Architecture)
• Thymeleaf (for frontend rendering)
• RestTemplate (for API calls)
• H2 In-Memory Database
• Maven
• Git & GitHub
• IntelliJ IDEA


📦 Features Being Implemented
• Fetching and displaying trending/popular movies.
• Searching movies by title.
• Viewing detailed information about each movie.
• Adding/removing movies from a favorites list.
• Viewing and managing the favorite movies stored in H2 database.


🔧 API Configuration Steps
1. Creating a TMDb account.
2. Generating the API Key.
3. Adding the API Key to `application.properties` file and the rest as per the instructions.
4. Using endpoints as mentioned in the instructions. 


🏗️ Project Structure
• Controller Layer – handling routing and view logic.
• Service Layer – processing data and business logic.
• Repository Layer – saving and retrieving favorite movies.
• Model Layer – defining movie entities.
• Thymeleaf templates for UI.


🚀 Running the Application
1. Cloning the GitHub repo.
2. Adding API key.
3. Running the app with Maven.
4. Accessing via localhost:8080.


🎯 Challenges Being Addressed
• Handling null/missing data from the API.
• Designing intuitive Thymeleaf templates.
• Avoiding duplication in favorites.
• Securing the API key in properties file.


🎬 Summary
Completed this Movie Catalogue System to demonstrate proficiency in Java Spring Boot, API integration, data handling, and web application development. Recorded a demo video to showcase all features and functionalities.
